# Python Scraper to Google Sheets

This was a really fun project to do, we integrated to google sheets utilizing its API, the code finds python or any other language you pass as parameter and returns to a google sheet.

## Core features I learned:
* How to work with gspread
* How to connect python to google cloud apis
* How to send data from python to a google sheet
